AI Tools Assignment: AI Tools and Applications
Theme: "Mastering the AI Toolkit" 🛠️🧠

Objective & Guidelines

This assignment evaluates your understanding of AI tools/frameworks and their real-world applications through a mix of theoretical and practical tasks. You’ll demonstrate proficiency in selecting, implementing, and critically analyzing AI tools to solve problems.

The assignment has three parts: theory, which tests the theoretical understanding of AI Tools; Practical, which tests the implementation skills of AI tools; and Ethics and optimization, which tests ethical AI development and AI software optimization skills. 

The assignment should be handled as group work formed by 3-5 people. This is to enhance teamwork and AI engineering collaboration.

Submission Guidelines

Code: Well-commented scripts/Jupyter notebooks. (To be submitted on GitHub)

Report: A PDF with:

Answers to theoretical questions. 

Screenshots of model outputs (e.g., accuracy graphs, NER results).

Ethical reflection.

(Share this PDF as an article in the Community, Peer Group Review and include it in the GitHub Repo)

Presentation: Create 3-minute video explaining your approach. (All members in the group should participate in the video. Share the video on the Community platform)

Post questions on the LMS Community with #AIToolsAssignment.

Pro Tip: Test code incrementally—small wins lead to big successes! 💡


Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)
1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

2. Comparative Analysis

Compare Scikit-learn and TensorFlow in terms of:

Target applications (e.g., classical ML vs. deep learning).

Ease of use for beginners.

Community support.

Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn

Dataset: Iris Species Dataset

Goal:

Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode labels).

Train a decision tree classifier to predict iris species.

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Deliverable: Python script/Jupyter notebook with comments explaining each step.

Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Goal:

Build a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.

Achieve >95% test accuracy.

Visualize the model’s predictions on 5 sample images.

Deliverable: Code with model architecture, training loop, and evaluation.

Task 3: NLP with spaCy

Text Data: User reviews from Amazon Product Reviews.

Goal:

Perform named entity recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.

Analyze sentiment (positive/negative) using a rule-based approach.

Deliverable: Code snippet and output showing extracted entities and sentiment.

Part 3: Ethics & Optimization (10%)
1. Ethical Considerations

Identify potential biases in your MNIST or Amazon Reviews model. How could tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or spaCy’s rule-based systems mitigate these biases?

2. Troubleshooting Challenge

Buggy Code: A provided TensorFlow script has errors (e.g., dimension mismatches, incorrect loss functions). Debug and fix the code.

Bonus Task (Extra 10%)

Deploy Your Model: Use Streamlit or Flask to create a web interface for your MNIST classifier. Submit a screenshot and a live demo link.
