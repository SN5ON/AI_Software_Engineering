Pro Tip: Start early and test incrementallyâ€”AI thrives on iteration! ðŸ”„
Part 1: Theoretical AnalysisÂ (30%)
1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?

Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

2. Case Study Analysis

Read the article:Â AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines.

Answer: How does AIOps improve software deployment efficiency? Provide two examples.

Part 2: Practical ImplementationÂ (60%)
Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

Tool: Use a code completion tool like GitHub Copilot or Tabnine.

Task:

Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

Compare the AI-suggested code with your manual implementation.

Document which version is more efficient and why.

Deliverable: Code snippets + 200-word analysis.

Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

Framework: Use Selenium IDE with AI plugins or Testim.io.

Task:

Automate a test case for a login page (valid/invalid credentials).

Run the test and capture results (success/failure rates).

Explain how AI improves test coverage compared to manual testing.

Deliverable: Test script + screenshot of results + 150-word summary.

Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

Dataset: Use Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset.

Goal:

Preprocess data (clean, label, split).

Train a model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict issue priority (high/medium/low).

Evaluate using accuracy and F1-score.

Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook + performance metrics.

Part 3: Ethical ReflectionÂ (10%)

Prompt: Your predictive model from Task 3 is deployed in a company. Discuss:

Potential biases in the dataset (e.g., underrepresented teams).

How fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 could address these biases.

Bonus Task (Extra 10%)

Innovation Challenge: Propose an AI tool to solve a software engineering problem not covered in class (e.g., automated documentation generation).

Deliverable: 1-page proposal outlining the toolâ€™s purpose, workflow, and impact.

##  Task 1: Predictive Modeling

- **Objective:** Train a machine learning model to classify breast cancer images as **benign** or **malignant**.
- **Techniques:**  
  - Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)  
  - CNN for deep learning  
  - Random Forest for tabular learning  
  - Evaluation using **Accuracy** and **F1 Score**
- **Result Summary:**  
  - Random Forest: Accuracy = `80%`, F1 (Malignant) = `0.54`  
  - CNN: Accuracy = `74.5%`, F1 (Malignant) = `0.00`

---

## ðŸ§ª Task 2: Automated Testing

- **Objective:** Automate test cases for a login form (valid & invalid credentials).
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Selenium IDE (browser plugin) or Testim.io  
  - AI-assisted test path detection
- **Deliverables:**  
  - `.side` file or Testim link  
  - Screenshot of test run  
  - Brief summary on **AIâ€™s role in improving test coverage**

---

## ðŸ§­ Task 3: Ethical Reflection

- **Focus Points:**  
  - Biases in breast cancer image datasets (e.g., underrepresentation of cases)  
  - Modelâ€™s real-world impact (false positives/negatives)  
  - Introduction of fairness tools like **IBM AIF360**

- **Deliverable:** `task3_ethics.md`  
  - 300â€“400 words explaining practical and ethical challenges in deployment
